A while ago I made a LUA script for the NES emulator FCEUX to time any% speedruns of Super Mario Bros 3. It displays number of attempts, time of the current run, and time of the last completed run. The timer starts and stops automatically by observing the emulator memory and registers, so you can just play and not worry about timers. You can [download the script here](https://gist.github.com/darrellenns/489487aeb714c27197848af9e8f6566c).
